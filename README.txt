Greetings uses a simple user interface. The user can start the companion app on their phone and then start Greetings on their Pebble. When alone, the user can shake the Pebble to request a new greeting. The Pebble app connects to the Android app, which then sends a randomly selected greeting back to the Pebble to be displayed. The user can then see the language the greeting is written in, followed by the actual greeting. Users can spend as much time as they want on their own simply shaking the app to read new greetings, or review an old one.
